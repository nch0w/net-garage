Build a neural network from your browser and help it learn (HackMIT 2022)

[LIVE DEMO](https://nch0w.github.io/net-garage/)

> Neural networks might seem mysterious, but understanding them becomes crucial as they become increasingly involved with our lives. Why not train one yourself, right now? Through NetGarage, you’ll train a real, working, TensorFlow-powered multilayer perceptron right from your browser. There are tooltips to show what different things mean (weights, biases, layers, activation functions, etc.), but you can also figure them out by just messing around. NetGarage is great for classrooms, professors, or for just sending to your friends who keep wanting you to explain deep learning. Also, there’s a dark theme.

Libraries used: TensorFlow, React, Plotly.js, Chakra UI, Color.js, Underscore.js
